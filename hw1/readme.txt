Problem1: This has been done directly in the PDF file. There is no code for this problem.

Problem2: The zip file has 2 codes for this problem (vid1.py and vid2.py). Make sure to change the file path in the code before running the code. The file vid1.py is for the non-noisy video, and the file vid2.py is for the noisy video. The math has been explained in the PDF file. 

Problem3: The zip file has 2 codes for this (hw1_q3_meth2.py and ransac.py). The file hw1_q3_meth2.py has the code for finding eigen values, eigen vectors, least square method and total least square method. The file ransac.py has the code for RANSAC. The advantages, disadvantages and some theory for all these methods have been explained in the PDF file. Make sure to change the file path before running the code.

Problem4: The part (a) of this question has been done in the PDF file. A file named HW1_Q4.ipynb contains the code for the (b) part of this problem. The final answer, homography matrix has been found in the code.

If you have any problems accessing or ruiining the codes then please reach out to me at dagrawa1@umd.edu.
